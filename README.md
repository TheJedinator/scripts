## Git Year in Review

A Spotify Wrapped-style year-in-review script for git repositories. Run `python git_year_in_review.py` in any git repository to see your coding stats for the current year, including total commits, lines added/removed, top directories you've worked in (smartly detecting common patterns like `src/` or `core_app/`), biggest commit day, most productive day of the week, most active coding hour, longest commit streak, favorite file types, and most-used commit words. Optionally pass a repository path as the first argument (`python git_year_in_review.py /path/to/repo`) and/or a custom start date as the second argument (`python git_year_in_review.py 2024-01-01` or `python git_year_in_review.py /path/to/repo 2024-01-01`). The script analyzes your git history and presents fun, meaningful insights about your coding patterns throughout the year.
